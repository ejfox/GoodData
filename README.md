#GoodData
---

Collecting good data sources to inspire visualizers.

Makes a quick [Tabletop](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) + [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/index.html)-based page to display the data sources listed in a [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApAkxBfw1JT4dEphMEpZM051NlM3RUlfTlRwcUtENlE) which I curate along with other members of [Mainstem](http://mainstem.org).

Send your suggestions for data sources to **ejfox@ejfox.com**
